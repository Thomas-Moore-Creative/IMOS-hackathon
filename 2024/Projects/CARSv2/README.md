# Can the AODN help us fill in key data gaps in the Australian EEZ / region?

Work done by [@ChrisC28](https://github.com/ChrisC28) & [@BecCowley](https://github.com/BecCowley) has identified gaps in even the most common baseline ocean observations ( temperature & salinity ) over all time for large areas of the Australian EEZ / region in state-of-the-art global databases like the [WOD](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-ocean-database).

For example this preliminary plot from [@ChrisC28](https://github.com/ChrisC28) shows the lack of any observations in the WOD for much of the Australian shelf & coast over all time. And regions with coverage may still suffer from seasonal aliasing?

## But are we missing local Australian data holdings not in WOD?
Important considerations for using the AODN could include:

How can we search across all observations and all platforms and over all time in these specific regions?
Does AODN data have any flags or metadata on what is / is not in the WOD or other global databases?
If we can identify observations not seen in the WOD can we make that selection across all platforms and grab a single data object with rich metadata on it's provenance?
Double checking for any duplication in WOD data already available.
